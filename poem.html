    <h1> TREES - <em> Joyce Kilmer</em> </h1>
    <p> 
    I think that I shall never see <br>
    A poem lovely as a <strong>tree</strong> <br>
    </p>
    <p> A <strong>tree</strong> whose hungry mouth is prest <br>
    Against the earth's <em>sweet</em> flowing breast; <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    A <strong>tree</strong> that looks at God all day, <br>
    And lifts her leafy arms to pray; <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    A <strong>tree</strong> that may in <em>Summer</em> wear <br>
    A nest of robins in her hair; <br>
    </p>
    <p>    
    Upon whose bosom snow has lain; <br>
    Who intimately lives with rain. <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    Poems are made by <em>fools</em> like me, <br>
    But only God can make a <strong>tree.</strong> <br>
