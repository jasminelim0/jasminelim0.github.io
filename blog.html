        <p>Something excited happened. While taking a delightful stroll in the park this afternoon I came across a lovely family of ducks. They were a little shy, but eventually warmed up to me. Quack Quack!</p>

        <p> Today was my friend's birthday! I got her some jewellery and baked her favourite cake.  We got together with a couple of other friends and had a movie night which was super <em>fun!</em>
